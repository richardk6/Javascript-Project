# JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

There is just one tiny problem though... the collection is too large to search through manually. Even the most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

I was hired to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset we provide](StarterCode/static/js/data.js), only using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on the web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted with such important data.

## Tasks Completed

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

* I used the [index.html] to display a UFO dataset in a table with columns for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* I wrote Javascript code in [app.js] that listensfor events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)

* Next, I decided to add additional search categories. I used [index_bonus.html] to display the UFO dataset just like above, but included additional attributes (city, state, and shape) to search under. I did not include country because all data is from the USA.

* I wrote avaScript code in [app_bonus.js] so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria (which are based on the table columns used):

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
